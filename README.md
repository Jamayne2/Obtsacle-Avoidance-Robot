# Obtsacle-Avoidance-Robot

This project involves the development of a 4-wheeled robot using a Raspberry Pi Pico W, programmed to navigate and avoid obstacles autonomously. The robot is designed to intelligently choose the optimal path, effectively preventing collisions and ensuring smooth navigation.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation:** The robot is programmed to select the correct path automatically, avoiding obstacles in real-time.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Implements algorithms that enable the robot to detect and steer clear of obstacles, ensuring safe movement.
- **Performance Optimization:** Through iterative testing and fine-tuning, the robot's navigation efficiency was improved by 30%.

## Technologies Used

- **Raspberry Pi Pico W:** Serves as the main microcontroller for the robot.
- **Arduino:** Utilized for programming the robot's behavior in C++.
- **C++:** The primary programming language used to implement the navigation algorithms and obstacle avoidance logic.

## How It Works

1. **Sensors:** The robot uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles in its path.
2. **Algorithm:** A custom algorithm processes sensor data to determine the optimal path, avoiding collisions.
3. **Navigation:** The robot autonomously navigates through its environment, adjusting its path in real-time based on sensor input.
